Introduction

For a single-person academic project, the techniques of scope management, planning, and risk management can be very useful to ensure that the project is completed on time and all requirements are met. The techniques of stakeholder management and resource management can also be useful, but are less suitable in most cases.\\ 

Before the project begins, it is crucial to define the \textbf{project scope} in order to have a clear idea of how to apply the remaining techniques. By defining a project scope, the goals, timeframes and constraints of the project are clearly established. For the individual project, the goals and timeframe are provided by the university, and it is important to have them present when going through the various stages of the project. Constraints for this project include the time restrictions imposed by the project being part-time, and the need for learning and background reading before the project work can be done.\\

Defining a project scope is crucial in order to effectively apply \textbf{planning}, an extremely useful technique. By considering various sections of the final paper as products, a comprehensive product list can be constructed. This allows the student to apply activity planning, which can then be used to establish a clear plan of action, as well as due dates for each project. Finally, by using a Gantt chart to visualize the plan, the student can clearly see how the project is progressing and re-plan with enough time to correct if they fall off track.\\

Throughout the whole project, \textbf{risk management} allows the student to keep track of and manage any risks that may arise. Examples of risks that may arise include unlikely events, e.g.\ hardware failure or a family issue, but also very likely ones, such as time estimate errors\cite{estimates}. By continually assessing the risks and assigning an exposure value to each one, the student can make changes to their plan depending on which risks have become more or less likely, and develop a contingency plan for when the risks do present themselves.\\

There are also techniques which are less applicable to the project, namely \textbf{stakeholder management} and \textbf{resource management}. The stakeholders of the project are, in most cases, the project advisor and the university, and the requirements of the project are given out at the start, leaving no need for continual assessment outside of advisor meetings. Managing resources is also less important in such a project where money is usually not a factor, physical resource requirements are small and the staff is reduced to one person.

\section*{Question 2}
Using the cloud instead of an in-house datacenter is a great way of saving costs for a small business, but it does not come without its costs. There are severe security concerns around storing data in the cloud, which are intensified by the fact that medical data is confidential and a data breach would be a very serious issue.

For secure environments, AWS provides the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which allows users to define a logically isolated environment in which to run their applications~\cite{vpc}. Together with Amazon RDS (Relational Database System), it can be used to store data securely in the cloud~\cite{rds}. This would be a perfect fit for the YorKlinic development team, who require these features to minimize the risk of a data breach and would otherwise have to implement them themselves, which would be a very large resource drain.\\
    
However, the development team would need to have both good security knowledge and practices to ensure that the data is kept securely. This would require the team to spend more time on security instead of development, which could be a drain on YorKlinic's resources~\cite{altoncloud}.\\

By using AWS instead of an in-house datacenter, YorKlinic will not have to spend resources on securing their hardware and can instead delegate this onto Amazon, who have more resources available to ensure security. Amazon's customer service can also provide assistance with any issues that would otherwise need to be tackled alone.\\

However, this comes with the disadvantage that YorKlinic would be trusting Amazon to keep the data secure, as any hardware issue could potentially leak data and this is completely out of YorKlinic's control. In addition, in the event that a data breach did happen, it might be impossible to hold Amazon accountable due to current legislation~\cite{cloudrisk}.

Another disadvantage is that online data is by nature more vulnerable than data stored on site, and thus it might be easier for an attacker to find a way to breach security. Since AWS has had data breaches in the past~\cite{breach}, it is clear that using their inbuilt security features is not enough, and additional care has to be put into security.\\

In conclusion, as long as YorKlinic has the resources to ensure that proper security practices are followed, AWS can provide superior security to what the startup could muster on their own. When used correctly, AWS can provide more security than an in-house datacenter could, as it allows YorKlinic to make use of their more secure infrastructure and wide range of security tools.

\section*{Question 3}

For safety-critical applications, it is essential for the supplier to correctly test their software in order to provide a strong guarantee that it is correct. Failure to do so can result in grave issues; nowhere is this more evident than in the Therac-25 accidents~\cite{therac}, where deaths and serious injuries were caused by programming errors and a lack of testing. Since an X-ray overdose can significantly increase the risk of cancer and even cause radiation sickness~\cite{rad}, there are parallels to be drawn to Therac-25, which means that rigorous testing should be performed to ensure that history does not repeat itself.

Stakeholders impacted: \begin{itemize}

    \item Patients\\
    The stakeholder most impacted by the decision of delaying the project or skipping testing are the patients receiving radiation therapy. Were the software engineer to choose not to delay, they would be willingly putting the patients in danger of an overdose. A delay would likely not affect the patients much, assuming that the current software that the x-ray machines use has been appropriately tested.

    \item Healthcare professionals\\
    Any issues caused by the x-ray machine would also require the patients' healthcare professionals to expend additional resources in order to heal them.

    \item Machine operators\\
    Another negatively impacted stakeholder are the x-ray machine operators. Firstly, a failure of the x-ray machine would render the results useless as the image produced would likely not be usable. In addition to this, were the machine to become unusable after a faliure this would require resources to be used to either repair or replace the machine.

    \item Company shareholders\\
    A delay in releasing the product would mainly affect the company's shareholders and executives, as it could potentially cause a loss of revenue due to more developer time needed for the release and a potential decrease in customer engagement. However, a software failure would likely cause heavy reputational damage for the company. Because any failure can put lives at stake, hospitals are likely to revoke their trust of the company at the first sign that their development practices are flawed.

    \item Company employees and staff\\
    Decrease in morale and company trust

    \item Engineers\\
    The technical people involved in the project would be negatively affected by a delay, which might make them incapable of continuing their work due to the critical path delay which would presumably be caused by the delay.

    \item Engineers break the ACM code of ethics\\
    Finally, the engineer writing the software would be breaching the ACM code of ethics~\cite{acm-ethics} and the BCS code of ethics~\cite{bcs-ethics}

\end{itemize}

Taking all this into account, there are very compelling reasons for delaying the deployment of the software, as every stakeholder involved would be negatively affected by a faliure. The only situation where it might be ethically acceptable to not delay the release is if the code is not safety-critical at all, although this seems unlikely for an x-ray machine.
